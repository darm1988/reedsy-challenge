- Why are you interested in Reedsy's mission?
    
    Reading is essential in every person's life. It is important to try to improve or make easier the way people access new quality content, specially books.

    What attracted me to reedsy, is not only that one of my favorite pass times is to read, but also that the company makes it easier for publishers and authors to access talented professionals, important tools and free educational content. By doing so, it promotes on of the most important habits a person can have, **reading**.

    I have been working mostly remotely for the past 2 years.
